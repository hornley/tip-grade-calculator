# TIP Grade Calculator

It's like the aris mobile app but you can customize the grades to your own liking.
- Such as **"what grade should I get in this exam to pass?"**, then enter different grades in the exam box to know whether you'll pass or not with that grade.

## How to use?
- The **blue** button is to add a category (Assigment, Assessment Task, Laboratory Activities, Quizzes, and more).
    - After adding a new category, enter the percentage of that category in the **second input box**.
- The **red** button is to add a sub-category or the actual *task* you've done and *add* more to your own liking.
    - Once you've added the sub-category, enter the grade you got or do your own experimentation.
- Navigate between Prelim, Midterm, and Final on the top of the page.
- The **delete** button is self-explanatory.
